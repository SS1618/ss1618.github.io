    <h1>Color Rendition of Prokudin-Gorskii Collection</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Prokudin-Gorskii Collection consists of photographs taken by Russian chemist and photographer, Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.
            For each scene, he captured three exposures with red, green, and blue filters. These photos were purchased by the Library of Congress in 1948.</p>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to write a program that can ingest RGB glass plate images and produce a colorized rendition of the scene.</p>
        <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>In order to construct a color version of the scenes, the three RGB glass plate images needed to be overlayed. Unfortuantely, they are not aligned with each other, so overlaying them would just create a strange image with discordant colors.</p>
